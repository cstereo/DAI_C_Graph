# DAI C graphical interfaces 

This project details how to use the Z88DK C compiler (github.com/z88dk/z88dk/wiki/Platform---Dai) with a DAI, a vintage computer from Data Application International
I also provides C interfaces to call ROM graphical functions (not available for the time being on the z88dk).
